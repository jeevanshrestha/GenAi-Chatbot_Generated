>> Hi
Hello! How can I assist you with your project today?
>> Lets create a Next js project
Sure! Could you please provide me with a name for your Next.js project?
>> JeevesNextApp
Great! I will create a new Next.js project named "JeevesNextApp" for you.

Here are the steps I will take:

 1. Create a new folder called "JeevesNextApp" in the current directory.
 2. Initialize a new Next.js project using the "npx create-next-app" command.
 3. Initialize a new git repository in the project folder.
 4. Add and commit all files to the git repository.
 
Let's proceed!

Creating a new Next.js project named 'JeevesNextApp'. This may take a few minutes.

Operation details:
Successfully created folder with write permissions: /home/ubuntu/projects/JeevesNextApp
Initialized git repository in /home/ubuntu/projects/JeevesNextApp
Error running npx command: npm warn exec The following package was not found and will be installed: create-next-app@15.3.3
'\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\ubuntu\projects\JeevesNextApp'
CMD.EXE was started with the above path as the current directory.
UNC paths are not supported.  Defaulting to Windows directory.
Could not create a project called "Windows" because of npm naming restrictions:
    * name can no longer contain capital letters

Error committing changes: 
>> create project files
Alright! I'm going to generate the basic files for a Next.js project for you in the "JeevesNextApp" folder.

For a basic Next.js project, these would be the directories and files:

1. The `pages` directory: This is a special directory where Next.js looks for your application's pages.

2. The `public` directory: This is where you put any static files that you want to serve directly.

3. The `styles` directory: This is where you put your CSS files.

4. The necessary config files such as `package.json`, `.gitignore`, and `README.md`.

Please give me a minute, I'm starting the process now. 

**Note:** Detailed configuration and customization of these files will be needed later based on your specific app requirements.
